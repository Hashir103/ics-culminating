                  <h1>Ontario's Safe School Strategy</h1>
                  <p>When a school has a positive climate, all members of the school community feel safe, included, accepted and actively promote positive behaviours and interactions with each other. Our Board conducts School Climate Surveys in our schools to hear directly from students, school staff and parents about their school climate. In late Fall of 2019, students in Grades 4-12, parents, and staff will be asked to complete the school climate survey. The results of the survey allow us to make informed planning decisions about programs to help prevent bullying and promote safe and inclusive schools.</p>

                      <h1>Progressive Discipline</h1>
                      <p> What is Progressive Discipline? </p>
                      <p>Every school in Ontario is required to have a progressive discipline policy.Through progressive discipline, principals determine appropriate consequences and/ or supports to help students improve their behaviour, while taking into account their individual circumstances. The goal is to help prevent inappropriate student behaviour from happening again.</p>
                      <p>When schools use progressive discipline, the following should be taken into consideration:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the students’ stage of growth and development</li>
                        <li>the nature and severity of the behaviour</li>
                        <li>the impact of the behaviour on the school climate</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Within this context, more serious consequences may be considered for inappropriate behaviour that escalates or is repeated. Providing students with the opportunity to reflect on their own actions and the impact of these actions is essential to student learning. </p>
                      <p>What Does This Mean in Practice?</p>
                      <p>Principals will consider a range of options to determine the most appropriate way to respond to each situation and help the student learn from his or her choices. These will include different supports and consequences.</p>
                      <p>Supports could include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>a conversation with the student</li>
                        <li>a review of expectations for the student’s behaviour</li>
                        <li>counselling from a social worker, for example, life skills coaching or anger management</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Consequences could include: </p>
                      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                        <li>an assignment </li>

                      <h1>Enrollment</h1>
                      <p>Students who reside within the City of Toronto have the right to attend a school which is designated to serve their residential address. The "Find Your School" section of the website identifies the designated schools for each residential address.</p>

                      <p>Students also have the opportunity to access schools outside of the school that is designated to serve their residential address by applying on optional attendance. Acceptance at these schools is subject to space availability and program suitability. The procedures, conditions and timelines relating to optional attendance are described in the Optional Attendance Policy and the Optional Attendance Operational Procedure </p>

                      <p>Each year in December, schools are classified as <b>limited</b> or <b>closed</b> to optional attendance based on the space they have available for the upcoming school year.</p>

                      <p>A school classified as <b>limited</b> can accept students on optional attendance. A limited school is not obliged to accept all students who apply on optional attendance. Acceptance is conditional upon space being available in the appropriate grade and program.</p>

                      <p>A school classified as <b>closed</b> cannot accept any students on optional attendance. Only students residing within the school's attendance area will be accepted.</p>

                      <strong>Please note that the optional attendance status is updated every December for admission in September of coming school year. Many schools that are limited have their available spaces filled in the spring. Please confirm if a limited school has space available by calling the school directly.</strong>
