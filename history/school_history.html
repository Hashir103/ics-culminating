            We have been operating for 29 strong years with the help of our parents, community, and students.
            Our students strive to go above and beyond.
            They are encouraged to go out and try and reach their goals in life and we, Bill Gates Specialized High School, 
            believe that offereing them with the best equipment is crucial for student success.

            We have always tried to support our students in what they strive to do, not contain them and control them. That is our policy.

            Our slogan is "Futurum nunc est" which means "The Future is Now".

            Individuality and celebrating one's achivements and sucesses is what we want our kids to do.
